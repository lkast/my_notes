##Product Level Boards:  
-product documentation, no source code, stories/issues written at customer perspective.  

###Stories and Issues:  
-As a [person] I want to [get something] so that I can [do something]  


##Component Level Boards: 
-application, service, or library that makes up a product, repo houses source code/documentation, issues are technical tasks.  

##Iteration:  
-Targeting every 2 weeks    
-Prioritize backlog, break up stories and move to ready  
-Grab story, move to "In Progress", responsible for its completion, github markdown is good for breaking down tasks  
-Grab a technical task: grab task on board, assign yourself, move to "In Progress", create pull request etc.  
-Reference product level story "Reachlocal/ProductName#IssueNumber", inform owner once completed  
-Retro meeting at end of iteration and ideation meeting  
-Issues can be closed with github commit name, would probz not happen on story-level ticket
